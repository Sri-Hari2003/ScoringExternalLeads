If you do e-commerce then you probably understand how important UGC videos are for your growth, it's one of the most high-ROI approach when it comes to paid growth and organic growth, at least, that's how it is years ago...

So the more messages users send, the higher our MRR.\n\nWe tried SEO, influencer marketing, inbound they\u00a0*barely*\u00a0moved the needle.\n\nBut\u00a0**outreach? That worked**.\n\nThe app is making around\u00a0**$50k MRR**, and it\u2019s still growing month over month.\n\nLet me walk you through the\u00a0**three main outreach channels**\u00a0I use, and how you can execute them for under $400/month.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 1. LinkedIn Outreach ($150/month)\n\n# Tools:\n\n* **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**\u00a0(Free Trial or \\~$99/month)\n* **Waalaxy**\u00a0(automated DM sequences)\n\n# How it works:\n\n1. I search for ecom founders/CMOs using Sales Navigator filters (e.g. Shopify + Brazil).\n2. Use Waalaxy to visit their profiles, send invites, then drip DMs.\n3. Message sequence goes something like:\n   * Invite \u2192 Friendly intro\n   * Follow-up \u2192 Short pitch\n   * Final \u2192 Demo CTA\n4. I average\u00a0**23% reply rate**\u00a0on these campaigns.\n5. Calls booked \u2192 Demo \u2192 Close (average first-tier plan: $159/month)\n\nWaalaxy gives you\u00a0**2 weeks free**, so you can get started right now for $0.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 2. Cold Email ($150/month)\n\n# Tools:\n\n* **Apollo**\u00a0(to build lead lists)\n* **GojiberryAI**\u00a0to find high intent leads\n* **Instantly**\u00a0(for automated cold email sequences)\n\n# The workflow:\n\n1. Use Apollo or tools like\u00a0**MyLeadFox**\u00a0to scrape ecom stores (e.g. Shopify Plus in Brazil).\n2. Enrich founder emails using Apollo or Clay.\n3. Plug them into Instantly and set up:\n   * 3\u20135 email sequences spaced over days\n   * Personalized subject lines &amp; body\n4. We send \\~1,700 emails/day.\n5. Positive replies \u2192 Demo \u2192 Close\n\nWe\u2019ve enriched\u00a0**thousands of leads**, and cold email alone brought in a big chunk of our revenue.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 3. Twitter DMs ($80/month)\n\n# Tool:\n\n* **DriPy**\u00a0(DM automation tool)\n\n# How I do it:\n\n1. Pick a relevant account in ecom/Shopify space.\n2. Scrape their followers using DriPy.\n3. DM people with a short, casual message like:\u201cHey, have you ever used WhatsApp marketing for your store?\u201d\n4. Set follow-ups inside DriPy, and run this daily.\n\nNot as powerful as email/LinkedIn, but still converts, especially when warmed up with content.\n\n# Funnel Recap:\n\nThe\u00a0*only*\u00a0goal of my outreach is to book\u00a0**demo calls**.\n\nMy funnel is simple:\n\n* **Prospect (use**\u00a0**gojiberry ai**\u00a0**) \u279d Message \u279d Demo\u279d Close**\n\nIf your product can be self-serve, even better people can install and pay directly.\n\nBut for us,\u00a0**demos convert better**, especially for higher ARPU clients.\n\n# Cost Breakdown (Monthly):\n\n|Tool|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n||\n|||\n|LinkedIn|\\~$150|\n|Email stack|\\~$150|\n|Twitter|\\~$80|\n|**Total**|**\\~$380**|\n\nAnd this system can bring in\u00a0**$50k+ MRR**, if done right.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\n* I\u2019m not a cold outreach guru.\n* I didn\u2019t use fancy scripts.\n* I just showed up daily, built lead lists, ran tests, optimized messages, and closed.\n\n**It works. It scales. It\u2019s repeatable.**\n\nIf you're building a SaaS and struggling with growth give this a try. Seriously. You don't need to go viral, raise money, or pray for Product Hunt.\n\nYou need leads.

I'm planning to list my cross-platform desktop SaaS app on Flippa and Acquire, but I’m unsure how to price it fairly — hoping to get some input from others with experience selling or buying similar projects.

Here’s a quick overview:

Revenue: $12,000 in the last 4 months

Profit margin: 90%+

Traffic: ~3000-4000 unique website visitors over 4 months (~10–50/day baseline, with spikes during Reddit posts)

AOV: 100-120$

Operational costs: Under $100/month

This isn't a mess of dozens of microservices, a complex CQRS pattern, or me trying to build my own authentication. It\u2019s not complexity for the sake of it.\n\nFor me, over-engineering was a conscious choice to shift from the typical startup mindset of **\""ship features at all costs\""** to **\""with a little extra time, could I build something that scales more elegantly and remains stable for longer?\""**\n\nI approached building my app, [Linksie](https://linksie.co), as if I were the CTO of the company. That meant building and laying down technological foundations for additional scale. If I were to bring on new engineers, what kind of sustainable and scalable foundation would I want in place?\n\nHere\u2019s how that philosophy turned out.   \n\n**The Codebase: A Monorepo**   \n\nThe entire project lives in a single monorepo, which keeps things organized. It's broken down into:\n\n**Application Services:**\n\n* NextJS Web App (Pages Router) for the front end.\n* HonoJS API for the backend.\n* Libraries: BetterAuth (auth), Tailwind &amp; Headless UI (UI/UX), Tanstack Query/Form (state management), and Stripe (payments).\n* Everything is containerized in Docker.\n\n**Worker Services:**\n\n* A dedicated service for database migrations.\n* A job task worker to handle asynchronous tasks like our referral system.\n\n\n**Shared Packages:**\n\n* This holds reusable code, primarily my database client interfaces for PostgreSQL and Redis, so both the API and the workers can use them consistently.\n\nI'm already pushing 30k lines of code. This isn't meant to be a flex or anything, it's just to give you a relative point for size. \n\n**The SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**  \nI wanted a smooth, professional development process from day one.\n\n* **Local Dev:** The entire stack spins up locally with a single docker-compose up command.\n* **CI/CD:** When code gets merged to main, a GitHub Actions pipeline automatically kicks off. It builds, tests, deploys all changes, and applies database migrations to a dedicated staging environment.\n* **Production:** After verifying everything on staging, I can trigger a manual deployment to production right from the GitHub UI.\nIs it a bit much for one person? Absolutely.\n\n**The Infrastructure (All Code, All Cloud)**  \n\nThis is where things get really \""extra.\"" About 90% of my infrastructure is declared in Terraform. I debated between AWS and GCP but ultimately chose Google Cloud because I love Cloud Run for its auto-scaling capabilities.\n\nHere\u2019s the stack:\n\n**Cloud Run:** For both my main services and background jobs. I can set min/max instances, and it handles the rest.\n**Cloud SQL:** A managed Postgres database.\n**Memorystore:** A managed Redis instance for caching.\n**Cloud Load Balancer, Cloud DNS &amp; VPC:** To manage traffic securely.\n**Secrets Manager &amp; Artifact Registry:** For credentials and container images.\nOutside of GCP, I'm using **Cloudflare** for DNS handling and their **R2 Buckets.**\n\n**Why go through all this trouble for an app with $0 revenue?**.  \n\nI know what you're thinking. \""This is insane. You could have built this for a fraction of the cost and time using Vercel, Supabase, etc.\"" And you're right.\n\nBut my reasons were simple:\n\n1-I Despise Vendor Lock-in.\n\nCompanies like Vercel are doing amazing things for the ecosystem. But at the end of the day, they are for-profit entities, and there are signs they might prioritize profits over developer experience. We've all seen the horror stories of insane, unexpected bills. We preach that clean, modular code is the way to go; I believe that should apply to your systems too. Owning my stack gives me freedom and predictability.\n\n2-This Was a Huge Opportunity for Growth.\n\nI'm primarily a full-stack product engineer. I understood infrastructure conceptually, but I\u2019d never had to get my hands dirty setting up containers, VPCs, or deploying infrastructure-as-code. This project forced me to fill a massive gap in my skillset. The counter-argument is \""just hire someone later,\"" but how can you effectively hire for a role you know nothing about? How do you know good from bad?\n\nEven if Linksie completely flops, I have zero regrets. The amount I learned about DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and building a robust system from the ground up has been invaluable. What am I doing next? Aggressively trying to hunt down customers. Even though I have a full time job that can cover costs, there's certainly some pressure of trying to make $$ when you're paying a pretty hefty amount of $$ for infra costs. \n\nIf I launched another SaaS now would I do the exact same thing? Not exactly. There's several things I'd definitely reuse like Google Cloud Run, Terraform, Secrets manager and probably same frontend/backend setup. But I'd definitely reconsider how my data layer is setup. Drop the Redis Cache (overkill), find a cheaper way to manage the Postgres DB, and then drop the staging environment. These are probably the biggest cost drivers right now in this application\n\nI'd totally encourage people to continue to build their skillsets and look for gaps where they can grow. AI really helps with amplifying that. I knew zero Terraform code and picked it up pretty quickly over 4-5 days. \n\nAnyhow, hope this was an interesting read among the sea of promotion posts. I did drop Linksie here, but the target market isn't really related to the visitors of this subreddit at all   \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

People can ace Leetcode questions but fail miserably at soft skills interviews just because they don\u2019t know how to tell a story. This is how\u00a0[InterviewStory.AI](http://interviewstory.ai/)\u00a0began.\n\nAs an engineer (my background is more in backend and devops), I gave myself a challenge: Build a side project without writing a single line of code. I can report that I actually managed to produce a fully working B2C SaaS product without writing any code. I was truly amazed I managed to pull this off, but if you go into the small details, vibe coding is not there yet to replace engineers. I think it is more of a 10X or even 100X product for engineers to become more efficient, but it still needs close supervision.\n\nBelow is my thoughts and stack on how I built [InterviewStory.AI](http://interviewstory.ai/), hope it will help people that are trying to build something themselves or managing a group of engineers and wondering if they can move faster.\n\n# The Stack\n\nLet\u2019s jump into the stack I used:\n\n* [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)\u00a0is one of the more popular vibe coding tools. I chose it for its simplicity and because it uses Supabase for DB and backend, and I wanted to check out Supabase for quite some time now. I also did not want to lose touch with the data and code. While some other vibe coding tools do everything for you (i.e., base44), I wanted to have access to the data and backend code.\n* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)\u00a0is a managed Postgres service with a nice dashboard and a simple-to-use SDK. You can build authorization super easily, build APIs, and manage your DB. It is connected to Lovable, and if you want to have migrations in your code, you should do everything via the Lovable chat and not do anything manually in the Supabase admin.\n* [Heygen](https://www.heygen.com/)\u00a0is a SaaS allowing you to integrate real-time avatars into your website and customize their knowledge. It is based on OpenAI, of course, but the avatar technology is amazing. I\u2019ve used their API to create the interview sessions.\n* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I guess no need to introduce the VS Code fork that is changing the engineering world. I used Cursor on hard problems that Lovable could not implement, mainly by choosing a super model manually that I guess Lovable just doesn\u2019t use on a regular basis. I mainly used Cursor for the integration of the Heygen SDK, which was not trivial.\n* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). While Lovable has its own deployment, for some reason it did not work for me. I just bought a domain at GoDaddy and then deployed it to Cloudflare Pages. The integration from Lovable to Cloudflare via GitHub is super simple and makes life easy. I did have some challenges with the build issue, but I threw the errors into Cursor and it came up with a solution to fix the build.\n* [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/). No Stripe in Israel, so I used Lemon Squeezy for payments. If it catches on, I will just use Stripe Atlas to open an entity in Delaware, but for now it\u2019s not worth the trouble.\n* ChatGPT for the logo.\n\n# Why you still need engineers in the process?\n\nThis is a bit more technical, but if you build your own SAAS and thinking about vibecoding, you should consider the following:\n\n* **Architecture.**\u00a0When I just started, I wrote a brief description of the project and wanted to see what I\u2019d get. The overall UI and website flow were good, but once you want real functionality \u2014 you must be super detailed in your prompt and bring all your years of experience to life.\n* **Security.**\u00a0As I mentioned above, Supabase uses a frontend SDK to connect the project to the DB. If you don\u2019t use Row Level Security (RLS) correctly, you will end up with users able to change their credits or any other data. Unfortunately, the AI is not there yet. It made some very horrible security designs and I had to fix them. True to the challenge, I changed them with prompts, but you need to work in small tasks and fix issues one by one. I don\u2019t see how it could be done in one long prompt or how someone non-technical could actually think about it if the AI is not doing it automatically. Too many of the core logics ended up in the frontend and not in the backend until I manually prompted them out.\n* **DB Management.**\u00a0Surprisingly, this part went quite well, but I still had to manually prompt indexes and proper data types, as the AI had some weird choices.\n* **Integrating Heygen SDK.**\u00a0This was the hardest part of the project. I tried using MCP via\u00a0[gitmcp.io](http://gitmcp.io/)\u00a0and putting the SDK docs URL into Cursor. It partially worked. I also ended up copying &amp; pasting code from the SDK demo repository into the Cursor chat window and prompting it to \u201cuse this code to implement the SDK.\u201d There were a lot of logic issues in the implementation causing some race conditions, slowness, and other bugs that I ended up reading the code and debugging manually (but still fixed everything using prompts). The integration took most of the time in the project.\n* **React rendering and multiple calls to the server.**\u00a0The basic setup of the project in Lovable caused a lot of re-rendering of components, which in turn caused multiple requests to the server on every page load. I had to prompt my way out of it and only caught it via the Network or Console tabs in the browser\u2019s DevTools. A regular person would not have noticed and I guess would end up with a slow project or a huge server bill.\n* **Deploying the project, integrating SMTP, Google Auth, payment and other overheads**\u00a0also benefited from my technical experience. For some, you could prompt, but you still need to know what you\u2019re looking for (DNS management, signing up for Google Auth or SMTP servers). Even if you provide clear documentation, I don\u2019t see how non-technical users could actually do it.\n* **Refactoring.**\u00a0Towards the end of the project, I decided to clean the code. I imported it to Cursor and used Gemini 2.5 Pro to go over all the code (big context window), removing uncalled functions, removing old components, and basically cleaning and refactoring. It worked pretty well with a couple of bugs (of course) that were fixed very quickly. I asked a very experienced friend to give feedback to the react code (overall, it is not a huge project) and he thinks it is good enough and meets the industry standards.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn conclusion, this was a cool side project and who knows, I might even see a couple of $$$ out of it as it is really a complementary product to Leetcode. I did not have a lot of time to work on it so it spread across a couple of months. I think if I combine all the hours together, it comes to about 3\u20134 weeks of work.\n\nTo be honest, I could not have built this project so fast without vibe coding. I estimate it would have taken me at least 6 months as a side project. Vibe coding is an amazing experience and I managed to go from idea to fully working solution at a speed I never experienced before \u2014 but it is not for non-technical users. I am at the beginning of a new journey for my main day job and part of this side project was to experiment with new technologies.

I also ended up copying &amp;amp; pasting code from the SDK demo repository into the Cursor chat window and prompting it to \u201cuse this code to implement the SDK.\u201d There were a lot of logic issues in the implementation causing some race conditions, slowness, and other bugs that I ended up reading the code and debugging manually (but still fixed everything using prompts). The integration took most of the time in the project.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;React rendering and multiple calls to the server.&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0The basic setup of the project in Lovable caused a lot of re-rendering of components, which in turn caused multiple requests to the server on every page load. I had to prompt my way out of it and only caught it via the Network or Console tabs in the browser\u2019s DevTools. A regular person would not have noticed and I guess would end up with a slow project or a huge server bill.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying the project, integrating SMTP, Google Auth, payment and other overheads&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0also benefited from my technical experience. For some, you could prompt, but you still need to know what you\u2019re looking for (DNS management, signing up for Google Auth or SMTP servers). Even if you provide clear documentation, I don\u2019t see how non-technical users could actually do it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring.&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Towards the end of the project, I decided to clean the code. I imported it to Cursor and used Gemini 2.5 Pro to go over all the code (big context window), removing uncalled functions, removing old components, and basically cleaning and refactoring. It worked pretty well with a couple of bugs (of course) that were fixed very quickly. I asked a very experienced friend to give feedback to the react code (overall, it is not a huge project) and he thinks it is good enough and meets the industry standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this was a cool side project and who knows, I might even see a couple of $$$ out of it as it is really a complementary product to Leetcode. I did not have a lot of time to work on it so it spread across a couple of months. I think if I combine all the hours together, it comes to about 3\u20134 weeks of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I could not have built this project so fast without vibe coding. I estimate it would have taken me at least 6 months as a side project. Vibe coding is an amazing experience and I managed to go from idea to fully working solution at a speed I never experienced before \u2014 but it is not for non-technical users. I am at the beginning of a new journey for my main day job and part of this side project was to experiment with new technologies. This was definitely worth the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"", ""likes"": null, ""suggested_sort"": null, ""banned_at_utc"": null, ""view_count"": null, ""archived"": false, ""no_follow"": true, ""is_crosspostable"": false, ""pinned"": false, ""over_18"": false, ""all_awardings"": [], ""awarders"": [], ""media_only"": false, ""can_gild"": false, ""spoiler"": false, ""locked"": false, ""author_flair_text"": null, ""treatment_tags"": [], ""visited"": false, ""removed_by"": null, ""num_reports"": null, ""distinguished"": null, ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_2qkq6"", ""author_is_blocked"": false, ""mod_reason_by"": null, ""removal_reason"": null, ""link_flair_background_color"": """", ""id"": ""1lfbfkb"", ""is_robot_indexable"": true, ""report_reasons"": null, ""author"": ""Main_Reading4802"", ""discussion_type"": null, ""num_comments"": 1, ""send_replies"": true, ""contest_mode"": false, ""mod_reports"": [], ""author_patreon_flair"": false, ""author_flair_text_color"": null, ""permalink"": ""/r/SaaS/comments/1lfbfkb/i_built_a_full_working_saas_with_only_vibecoding/"", ""stickied"": false, ""url"": ""https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lfbfkb/i_built_a_full_working_saas_with_only_vibecoding/"", ""subreddit_subscribers"": 321611, ""created_utc"": 1750341337.0, ""num_crossposts"": 0, ""media"": null, ""is_video"": false}","{'subreddit': 'SaaS', 'score': 1, 'comments': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 0.67, 'post_id': '1lfbfkb', 'flair': None, 'gilded': 0, 'over_18': False}"

I'm planning to list my cross-platform desktop SaaS app on Flippa and Acquire, but I’m unsure how to price it fairly — hoping to get some input from others with experience selling or buying similar projects.

Profit margin: 90%+

Traffic: ~3000-4000 unique website visitors over 4 months (~10–50/day baseline, with spikes during Reddit posts)

Some were overhyped, and some were underrated. A few of them saved my sanity.\n\nSo I thought I\u2019d share an honest breakdown of the tools that have worked for me, both as a solo SaaS builder and as a freelance developer delivering for clients.\n\nNo hype. No affiliate spam. Just what\u2019s helped me build and ship.\n\n# \ud83d\udd27 Tools That Stuck With Me\n\n# 1. \ud83e\udde0 AI Coding IDEs: Cursor vs Augment\n\n# Cursor \u2013 My daily workhorse\n\nCursor feels like coding with a super helpful teammate who\u2019s read your entire repo.\n\n* It gives real-time context about files, functions, even terminal output\n* It\u2019s basically VS Code with GPT-4 embedded natively\n* You can debug, refactor, and even scaffold entire features without leaving the editor\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Best for: solo devs, quick projects, MVPs, side hustle speed\n\n# Augment \u2013 The grown-up version\n\nWhen I worked on a bigger codebase for a client, Augment was a beast. It can:\n\n* Understand and refactor across large repos\n* Auto-generate test cases\n* Guide architectural decisions (kind of opinionated, but smart)\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Best for: larger projects, multi-dev teams, or when you hit complexity walls\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* Cursor = fast &amp; fluid, perfect for solo work\n* Augment = structure &amp; scalability, great for serious builds\n\n# 2. \ud83c\udfa8 UI Generation: [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) vs Bolt\n\n# [Lovable.dev](http://Lovable.dev) \u2013 For non-designers like me\n\nGive it a prompt like \u201cadmin dashboard with sidebar and cards,\u201d and boom \u2014 you get clean, responsive Tailwind + ShadCN UI code.\n\n* Works great with React/Vite projects\n* GitHub export is smooth\n* Supabase queries included (but I always double-check them)\n\nIt\u2019s like ChatGPT + Figma + Webflow had a baby. And that baby writes clean React code.\n\n# Bolt \u2013 For quick and dirty mockups\n\nBolt is more like a canvas-based prototyper. Good for testing layouts or building out quick landing pages. But the UI usually needs some cleanup.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Freelance note: Lovable helped me impress clients without hiring a designer. Made handoffs smoother, too.\n\n# 3. \ud83d\udee0 Backend &amp; Auth: Supabase\n\nI used Firebase earlier, but honestly, Supabase just gets solo developers.\n\n* Auth that works out of the box (Google, GitHub, email magic links)\n* Postgres with built-in APIs\n* RLS (Row-Level Security) is a blessing for multi-user apps\n* Bonus: edge functions, rate limiting, file storage \u2014 all included\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Just a heads up: if you\u2019re using Lovable to auto-generate Supabase queries, verify them using ChatGPT or Claude. Sometimes they miss subtle stuff around joins or RLS logic.\n\n# 4. \ud83e\udde9 Other Tools in My Stack\n\nHere\u2019s everything else that supports the build:\n\n* Vercel / Render \u2013 for hosting frontend + backend (I prefer Vercel with React/Vite)\n* Wasabi \u2013 affordable S3-compatible storage (great if you\u2019re handling files)\n* Weaviate \u2013 my go-to vector DB for anything AI + search related\n* Redis + Celery \u2013 for async tasks and caching\n* Stripe / Razorpay \u2013 billing + subscription handling (Stripe for global, Razorpay for India)\n* OpenAI / Claude / Gemini \u2013 for document parsing, summarization, UI generation, and more\n\n# \u2699\ufe0f My Workflow Right Now\n\n* Frontend: Vite + React + Lovable-generated UI\n* Backend: Supabase (auth, db, edge functions)\n* IDE: Cursor daily, Augment occasionally\n* Infra: Mostly Vercel\n* AI Glue: OpenAI + Claude (especially helpful when reviewing auto-generated queries)\n\n# \ud83d\udca1 Things I\u2019ve Learned (So Far)\n\n1. Move fast first, refine later. Cursor + Lovable let me go from idea \u2192 working prototype in hours. Then I clean up what matters.\n2. Don\u2019t blindly trust AI. Even great tools hallucinate. Always check DB queries, auth flows, and business logic before shipping.\n3. Design isn\u2019t optional. Users judge your UI first. A clean, modern interface builds trust, even if the backend is still duct-taped together.\n4. Use tools based on your phase. Don\u2019t get tool FOMO. Pick what helps you now, not what your Twitter hero uses on their 50-person team.\n\n# \ud83d\udd04 Your Turn\n\nWhat\u2019s in your current stack?\n\n* Are you using tools like Cursor, Continue, or Codeium?\n* Has anyone here tried better design tools for devs who hate Figma?\n* Have you used Supabase or Weaviate in production?\n\nLet\u2019s turn this into a useful thread \u2014 whether you\u2019re building a SaaS, freelancing, or exploring AI dev tooling."", ""author_fullname"": ""t2_kvarlyd62"", ""saved"": false, ""mod_reason_title"": null, ""gilded"": 0, ""clicked"": false, ""title"": ""As a Solo Dev + Freelancer, These Are the Tools Actually Helping Me Build and Ship an AI SaaS in 2025"", ""link_flair_richtext"": [], ""subreddit_name_prefixed"": ""r/SaaS"", ""hidden"": false, ""pwls"": 6, ""link_flair_css_class"": null, ""downs"": 0, ""thumbnail_height"": null, ""top_awarded_type"": null, ""hide_score"": false, ""name"": ""t3_1le9ica"", ""quarantine"": false, ""link_flair_text_color"": ""dark"", ""upvote_ratio"": 1.0, ""author_flair_background_color"": null, ""subreddit_type"": ""public"", ""ups"": 1, ""total_awards_received"": 0, ""media_embed"": {}, ""thumbnail_width"": null, ""author_flair_template_id"": null, ""is_original_content"": false, ""user_reports"": [], ""secure_media"": null, ""is_reddit_media_domain"": false, ""is_meta"": false, ""category"": null, ""secure_media_embed"": {}, ""link_flair_text"": null, ""can_mod_post"": false, ""score"": 1, ""approved_by"": null, ""is_created_from_ads_ui"": false, ""author_premium"": false, ""thumbnail"": ""self"", ""edited"": false, ""author_flair_css_class"": null, ""author_flair_richtext"": [], ""gildings"": {}, ""post_hint"": ""self"", ""content_categories"": null, ""is_self"": true, ""mod_note"": null, ""created"": 1750225935.0, ""link_flair_type"": ""text"", ""wls"": 6, ""removed_by_category"": null, ""banned_by"": null, ""author_flair_type"": ""text"", ""domain"": ""self.SaaS"", ""allow_live_comments"": false, ""selftext_html"": ""&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\""md\""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey folks \ud83d\udc4b&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m currently bootstrapping my own AI-powered SaaS product.

People can ace Leetcode questions but fail miserably at soft skills interviews just because they don\u2019t know how to tell a story. This is how\u00a0[InterviewStory.AI](http://interviewstory.ai/)\u00a0began.\n\nAs an engineer (my background is more in backend and devops), I gave myself a challenge: Build a side project without writing a single line of code. I can report that I actually managed to produce a fully working B2C SaaS product without writing any code. I was truly amazed I managed to pull this off, but if you go into the small details, vibe coding is not there yet to replace engineers. I think it is more of a 10X or even 100X product for engineers to become more efficient, but it still needs close supervision.\n\nBelow is my thoughts and stack on how I built [InterviewStory.AI](http://interviewstory.ai/), hope it will help people that are trying to build something themselves or managing a group of engineers and wondering if they can move faster.\n\n# The Stack\n\nLet\u2019s jump into the stack I used:\n\n* [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)\u00a0is one of the more popular vibe coding tools. I chose it for its simplicity and because it uses Supabase for DB and backend, and I wanted to check out Supabase for quite some time now. I also did not want to lose touch with the data and code. While some other vibe coding tools do everything for you (i.e., base44), I wanted to have access to the data and backend code.\n* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)\u00a0is a managed Postgres service with a nice dashboard and a simple-to-use SDK. You can build authorization super easily, build APIs, and manage your DB. It is connected to Lovable, and if you want to have migrations in your code, you should do everything via the Lovable chat and not do anything manually in the Supabase admin.\n* [Heygen](https://www.heygen.com/)\u00a0is a SaaS allowing you to integrate real-time avatars into your website and customize their knowledge. It is based on OpenAI, of course, but the avatar technology is amazing. I\u2019ve used their API to create the interview sessions.\n* [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). I guess no need to introduce the VS Code fork that is changing the engineering world. I used Cursor on hard problems that Lovable could not implement, mainly by choosing a super model manually that I guess Lovable just doesn\u2019t use on a regular basis. I mainly used Cursor for the integration of the Heygen SDK, which was not trivial.\n* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). While Lovable has its own deployment, for some reason it did not work for me. I just bought a domain at GoDaddy and then deployed it to Cloudflare Pages. The integration from Lovable to Cloudflare via GitHub is super simple and makes life easy. I did have some challenges with the build issue, but I threw the errors into Cursor and it came up with a solution to fix the build.\n* [Lemon Squeezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/). No Stripe in Israel, so I used Lemon Squeezy for payments. If it catches on, I will just use Stripe Atlas to open an entity in Delaware, but for now it\u2019s not worth the trouble.\n* ChatGPT for the logo.\n\n# Why you still need engineers in the process?\n\nThis is a bit more technical, but if you build your own SAAS and thinking about vibecoding, you should consider the following:\n\n* **Architecture.**\u00a0When I just started, I wrote a brief description of the project and wanted to see what I\u2019d get. The overall UI and website flow were good, but once you want real functionality \u2014 you must be super detailed in your prompt and bring all your years of experience to life.\n* **Security.**\u00a0As I mentioned above, Supabase uses a frontend SDK to connect the project to the DB. If you don\u2019t use Row Level Security (RLS) correctly, you will end up with users able to change their credits or any other data. Unfortunately, the AI is not there yet. It made some very horrible security designs and I had to fix them. True to the challenge, I changed them with prompts, but you need to work in small tasks and fix issues one by one. I don\u2019t see how it could be done in one long prompt or how someone non-technical could actually think about it if the AI is not doing it automatically. Too many of the core logics ended up in the frontend and not in the backend until I manually prompted them out.\n* **DB Management.**\u00a0Surprisingly, this part went quite well, but I still had to manually prompt indexes and proper data types, as the AI had some weird choices.\n* **Integrating Heygen SDK.**\u00a0This was the hardest part of the project. I tried using MCP via\u00a0[gitmcp.io](http://gitmcp.io/)\u00a0and putting the SDK docs URL into Cursor. It partially worked. I also ended up copying &amp; pasting code from the SDK demo repository into the Cursor chat window and prompting it to \u201cuse this code to implement the SDK.\u201d There were a lot of logic issues in the implementation causing some race conditions, slowness, and other bugs that I ended up reading the code and debugging manually (but still fixed everything using prompts). The integration took most of the time in the project.\n* **React rendering and multiple calls to the server.**\u00a0The basic setup of the project in Lovable caused a lot of re-rendering of components, which in turn caused multiple requests to the server on every page load. I had to prompt my way out of it and only caught it via the Network or Console tabs in the browser\u2019s DevTools. A regular person would not have noticed and I guess would end up with a slow project or a huge server bill.\n* **Deploying the project, integrating SMTP, Google Auth, payment and other overheads**\u00a0also benefited from my technical experience. For some, you could prompt, but you still need to know what you\u2019re looking for (DNS management, signing up for Google Auth or SMTP servers). Even if you provide clear documentation, I don\u2019t see how non-technical users could actually do it.\n* **Refactoring.**\u00a0Towards the end of the project, I decided to clean the code. I imported it to Cursor and used Gemini 2.5 Pro to go over all the code (big context window), removing uncalled functions, removing old components, and basically cleaning and refactoring. It worked pretty well with a couple of bugs (of course) that were fixed very quickly. I asked a very experienced friend to give feedback to the react code (overall, it is not a huge project) and he thinks it is good enough and meets the industry standards.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn conclusion, this was a cool side project and who knows, I might even see a couple of $$$ out of it as it is really a complementary product to Leetcode. I did not have a lot of time to work on it so it spread across a couple of months. I think if I combine all the hours together, it comes to about 3\u20134 weeks of work.\n\nTo be honest, I could not have built this project so fast without vibe coding. I estimate it would have taken me at least 6 months as a side project. Vibe coding is an amazing experience and I managed to go from idea to fully working solution at a speed I never experienced before \u2014 but it is not for non-technical users. I am at the beginning of a new journey for my main day job and part of this side project was to experiment with new technologies.

We offer an online Course, an online Group with video calls and an online forum, and 1 on 1 video Calls. We have thousands of customers and hundreds of subscribers at any given time.

We\u2019ve built our business around their CRM and Sales Hub tools, and for the most part, the platform has worked well for us.\n\nBut recently, something happened that really shook my trust.\n\nOut of nowhere, our account was **upgraded to Sales Hub Professional**, but we were only given **1 sales seat** \u2014 despite previously having **5 seats** under Sales Hub Starter. On top of that, **our group meeting scheduling link was deleted**, which has directly caused us to lose **two full days of client appointments** (a real financial hit).\n\nI reached out to our rep, and he told me this is a **system-wide update** affecting all customers. But here\u2019s where it gets sticky:\n\nEarlier this year, I raised a similar issue to **Yamini Rangan**, the CEO of HubSpot, when they removed the **calendar view from the mobile app**. Yamini personally acknowledged that **core features should not be removed mid-contract**. At the time, I appreciated the transparency and took it as a sign that HubSpot was committed to doing right by customers.\n\nNow it feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 only worse. Not only were core features removed, but we\u2019re essentially being asked to **pay more to get back the same functionality** we had under contract. That feels like a **bait-and-switch**, which, under **Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A**, could be considered a deceptive business practice.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s especially unfair:  \n**How can two parties sign a contract, agree to terms, and then only** ***one side*** **\u2014 the vendor \u2014 gets to change those terms, specifically to make more money?** If we tried to do the same to our clients, we\u2019d be sued.\n\nI get that SaaS companies need to evolve.

We\u2019ve built our business around their CRM and Sales Hub tools, and for the most part, the platform has worked well for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But recently, something happened that really shook my trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of nowhere, our account was &lt;strong&gt;upgraded to Sales Hub Professional&lt;/strong&gt;, but we were only given &lt;strong&gt;1 sales seat&lt;/strong&gt; \u2014 despite previously having &lt;strong&gt;5 seats&lt;/strong&gt; under Sales Hub Starter. On top of that, &lt;strong&gt;our group meeting scheduling link was deleted&lt;/strong&gt;, which has directly caused us to lose &lt;strong&gt;two full days of client appointments&lt;/strong&gt; (a real financial hit).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached out to our rep, and he told me this is a &lt;strong&gt;system-wide update&lt;/strong&gt; affecting all customers. But here\u2019s where it gets sticky:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I raised a similar issue to &lt;strong&gt;Yamini Rangan&lt;/strong&gt;, the CEO of HubSpot, when they removed the &lt;strong&gt;calendar view from the mobile app&lt;/strong&gt;. Yamini personally acknowledged that &lt;strong&gt;core features should not be removed mid-contract&lt;/strong&gt;. At the time, I appreciated the transparency and took it as a sign that HubSpot was committed to doing right by customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 only worse. Not only were core features removed, but we\u2019re essentially being asked to &lt;strong&gt;pay more to get back the same functionality&lt;/strong&gt; we had under contract. That feels like a &lt;strong&gt;bait-and-switch&lt;/strong&gt;, which, under &lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A&lt;/strong&gt;, could be considered a deceptive business practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s what\u2019s especially unfair:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;How can two parties sign a contract, agree to terms, and then only&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one side&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;\u2014 the vendor \u2014 gets to change those terms, specifically to make more money?&lt;/strong&gt; If we tried to do the same to our clients, we\u2019d be sued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get that SaaS companies need to evolve. But downgrading our access mid-term, then upselling it back to us, undermines trust and feels deeply one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re not against product updates.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re not asking for anything extra.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We just want the tools we signed up for \u2014 and that we were &lt;strong&gt;assured wouldn\u2019t be taken away&lt;/strong&gt; during the term of our agreement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ve asked for the following by tomorrow:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Restore our 4 Sales seats (we had 5 before).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reinstate our deleted group scheduling link.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid future mid-contract removals of core functionality.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else experienced something like this with HubSpot (or another SaaS provider)?&lt;br/&gt;\nIs this something that could justify legal action, or are we being overly sensitive?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any insights \u2014 or similar experiences \u2014 would really help us figure out our next steps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Phil Ganz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nPresident, Next Wave Mortgage&lt;br/&gt;\n\ud83d\udcde 617-529-9317&lt;br/&gt;\n\ud83d\udce7 [&lt;a href=\""mailto:philipdganz@gmail.com\""&gt;philipdganz@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;]()&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;"", ""likes"": null, ""suggested_sort"": null, ""banned_at_utc"": null, ""view_count"": null, ""archived"": false, ""no_follow"": true, ""is_crosspostable"": false, ""pinned"": false, ""over_18"": false, ""all_awardings"": [], ""awarders"": [], ""media_only"": false, ""can_gild"": false, ""spoiler"": false, ""locked"": false, ""author_flair_text"": null, ""treatment_tags"": [], ""visited"": false, ""removed_by"": null, ""num_reports"": null, ""distinguished"": null, ""subreddit_id"": ""t5_2qkq6"", ""author_is_blocked"": false, ""mod_reason_by"": null, ""removal_reason"": null, ""link_flair_background_color"": """", ""id"": ""1lg10t0"", ""is_robot_indexable"": true, ""report_reasons"": null, ""author"": ""MortgageMadeEasy"", ""discussion_type"": null, ""num_comments"": 3, ""send_replies"": true, ""contest_mode"": false, ""mod_reports"": [], ""author_patreon_flair"": false, ""author_flair_text_color"": null, ""permalink"": ""/r/SaaS/comments/1lg10t0/hubspot_removed_features_midcontract_and_tried_to/"", ""stickied"": false, ""url"": ""https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1lg10t0/hubspot_removed_features_midcontract_and_tried_to/"", ""subreddit_subscribers"": 321611, ""created_utc"": 1750416836.0, ""num_crossposts"": 0, ""media"": null, ""is_video"": false}","{'subreddit': 'SaaS', 'score': 2, 'comments': 3, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'post_id': '1lg10t0', 'flair': None, 'gilded': 0, 'over_18': False}"
