Think LinkedIn meets Shopify, but for cannabis and ancillary businesses.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s boring and doesn\u2019t really have a good look or feel to it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll admit it, the bones are there, the (9k non-paying) members are there, but the vision hasn\u2019t been fully realized yet. I\u2019ve been busy running multiple cannabis businesses i.e. retail, distribution, cultivation, you name it, and while SMJ has been quietly growing, it\u2019s now time for a real pivot.\n\nWhy now? Weedmaps has an absolute stranglehold on the U.S. cannabis industry, and it\u2019s toxic (imho). They charge ridiculous fees, bait and switch people on pricing, and treat small businesses like they\u2019re disposable. I know personally because they treated my businesses really badly. Their focus on just \u201cretail\u201d cannabis businesses is narrow.\u00a0\n\nThe cannabis industry deserves better and there is a place for a new, better player.\n\nI created SMJ to be that better business.\u00a0 I have been trying to create a space that\u2019s fair, transparent, and designed to help everyone in the cannabis industry thrive, especially the businesses that get left out of the conversation because they are not retailers. I want SMJ to become a platform where each business and business owner can have their own page, post deals/coupons, upload media and articles, get analytics, and even run their own shop. Basically, it would be a white-labeled Shopify, Substack, Yelp, Craigslist, and Squarespace combo for cannabis.\n\nAll for a reasonable monthly subscription of course.\n\nBut obviously due to the completely non-paying membership I\u2019ve unfortunately created, this isn\u2019t working for me anymore.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m looking for a tech God or Goddess to help me out. Someone who can help me redesign and optimize the user experience, add core features like upgraded member dashboards, geolocation, automation, and payment integration, and turn this site into a platform people love to use. Ideally, you're comfortable with marketplaces, scalable infrastructure, and creating a beautiful, functional front-end.\n\nI also need a sales rockstar. Someone who understands the cannabis and hemp space, or can learn quickly, and knows how to sell an SaaS-style platform and also sell advertising and coupon opportunities.\u00a0 This person would help shape the offers, messaging, and do the actual outreach. If you have experience with affiliates, event marketing, or B2B outreach, even better.\n\nI'm looking to create a place where cannabis businesses and folks in the industry can show their business off. I'm not looking for a news blog. I want this to be solely about individual businesses, who they are, what they do and what they have to offer. Need a plumber that can fix the water systems in your greenhouse at 4AM? Looking for a farm that gives tours? Want the fire weed of the week? Looking for a used part for that extractor? Find it on SMJ.\n\nI am offering a small equity stake in return. This is negotiable but real for the right two people that fit this description. This is an early-stage play that I\u2019ve bootstrapped this far and I already have thousands of members in place. I am ready to go full-in on building SMJ into something great, but I don\u2019t have any more cash to put into the project. I only have equity to offer.\u00a0\n\nWhat you earn is what we can produce together.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a way into the cannabis world, and a job you can do from anywhere in the world, this might be it.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s build something smarter, fairer, and more useful to the cannabis community than Weedmaps ever dreamed of. BTW as of this writing, Weedmaps has a $112 million dollar valuation. They sell air.\u00a0\n\nMessage me or leave a comment if you're interested. I\u2019m looking for serious people only. Let's not waste each other's time. You know if you have what it takes.

We helped e-commerce brands do WhatsApp marketing, it's super effective, and the install numbers + activation rates speak for themselves (I now sold this SAAS for 7 figures)\n\nOur revenue was usage-based, with recurring components tied to WhatsApp credits. So the more messages users send, the higher our MRR.\n\nWe tried SEO, influencer marketing, inbound they\u00a0*barely*\u00a0moved the needle.\n\nBut\u00a0**outreach? That worked**.\n\nThe app is making around\u00a0**$50k MRR**, and it\u2019s still growing month over month.\n\nLet me walk you through the\u00a0**three main outreach channels**\u00a0I use, and how you can execute them for under $400/month.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 1. LinkedIn Outreach ($150/month)\n\n# Tools:\n\n* **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**\u00a0(Free Trial or \\~$99/month)\n* **Waalaxy**\u00a0(automated DM sequences)\n\n# How it works:\n\n1. I search for ecom founders/CMOs using Sales Navigator filters (e.g. Shopify + Brazil).\n2. Use Waalaxy to visit their profiles, send invites, then drip DMs.\n3. Message sequence goes something like:\n   * Invite \u2192 Friendly intro\n   * Follow-up \u2192 Short pitch\n   * Final \u2192 Demo CTA\n4. I average\u00a0**23% reply rate**\u00a0on these campaigns.\n5. Calls booked \u2192 Demo \u2192 Close (average first-tier plan: $159/month)\n\nWaalaxy gives you\u00a0**2 weeks free**, so you can get started right now for $0.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 2. Cold Email ($150/month)\n\n# Tools:\n\n* **Apollo**\u00a0(to build lead lists)\n* **GojiberryAI**\u00a0to find high intent leads\n* **Instantly**\u00a0(for automated cold email sequences)\n\n# The workflow:\n\n1. Use Apollo or tools like\u00a0**MyLeadFox**\u00a0to scrape ecom stores (e.g. Shopify Plus in Brazil).\n2. Enrich founder emails using Apollo or Clay.\n3. Plug them into Instantly and set up:\n   * 3\u20135 email sequences spaced over days\n   * Personalized subject lines &amp; body\n4. We send \\~1,700 emails/day.\n5. Positive replies \u2192 Demo \u2192 Close\n\nWe\u2019ve enriched\u00a0**thousands of leads**, and cold email alone brought in a big chunk of our revenue.\n\n# \ud83d\udd39 3. Twitter DMs ($80/month)\n\n# Tool:\n\n* **DriPy**\u00a0(DM automation tool)\n\n# How I do it:\n\n1. Pick a relevant account in ecom/Shopify space.\n2. Scrape their followers using DriPy.\n3. DM people with a short, casual message like:\u201cHey, have you ever used WhatsApp marketing for your store?\u201d\n4. Set follow-ups inside DriPy, and run this daily.\n\nNot as powerful as email/LinkedIn, but still converts, especially when warmed up with content.\n\n# Funnel Recap:\n\nThe\u00a0*only*\u00a0goal of my outreach is to book\u00a0**demo calls**.\n\nMy funnel is simple:\n\n* **Prospect (use**\u00a0**gojiberry ai**\u00a0**) \u279d Message \u279d Demo\u279d Close**\n\nIf your product can be self-serve, even better people can install and pay directly.\n\nBut for us,\u00a0**demos convert better**, especially for higher ARPU clients.\n\n# Cost Breakdown (Monthly):\n\n|Tool|Cost|\n|:-|:-|\n||\n|||\n|LinkedIn|\\~$150|\n|Email stack|\\~$150|\n|Twitter|\\~$80|\n|**Total**|**\\~$380**|\n\nAnd this system can bring in\u00a0**$50k+ MRR**, if done right.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\n* I\u2019m not a cold outreach guru.\n* I didn\u2019t use fancy scripts.\n* I just showed up daily, built lead lists, ran tests, optimized messages, and closed.\n\n**It works. It scales. It\u2019s repeatable.**\n\nIf you're building a SaaS and struggling with growth give this a try. Seriously.

It covers everyone from farms and dispensaries to edible makers, trimmers, media pros, lawyers, packaging companies, and more. It's B2B, B2C, and international. Think LinkedIn meets Shopify, but for cannabis and ancillary businesses.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s boring and doesn\u2019t really have a good look or feel to it.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll admit it, the bones are there, the (9k non-paying) members are there, but the vision hasn\u2019t been fully realized yet. I\u2019ve been busy running multiple cannabis businesses i.e. retail, distribution, cultivation, you name it, and while SMJ has been quietly growing, it\u2019s now time for a real pivot.\n\nWhy now? Weedmaps has an absolute stranglehold on the U.S. cannabis industry, and it\u2019s toxic (imho). They charge ridiculous fees, bait and switch people on pricing, and treat small businesses like they\u2019re disposable. I know personally because they treated my businesses really badly. Their focus on just \u201cretail\u201d cannabis businesses is narrow.\u00a0\n\nThe cannabis industry deserves better and there is a place for a new, better player.\n\nI created SMJ to be that better business.\u00a0 I have been trying to create a space that\u2019s fair, transparent, and designed to help everyone in the cannabis industry thrive, especially the businesses that get left out of the conversation because they are not retailers. I want SMJ to become a platform where each business and business owner can have their own page, post deals/coupons, upload media and articles, get analytics, and even run their own shop. Basically, it would be a white-labeled Shopify, Substack, Yelp, Craigslist, and Squarespace combo for cannabis.\n\nAll for a reasonable monthly subscription of course.\n\nBut obviously due to the completely non-paying membership I\u2019ve unfortunately created, this isn\u2019t working for me anymore.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m looking for a tech God or Goddess to help me out. Someone who can help me redesign and optimize the user experience, add core features like upgraded member dashboards, geolocation, automation, and payment integration, and turn this site into a platform people love to use. Ideally, you're comfortable with marketplaces, scalable infrastructure, and creating a beautiful, functional front-end.\n\nI also need a sales rockstar. Someone who understands the cannabis and hemp space, or can learn quickly, and knows how to sell an SaaS-style platform and also sell advertising and coupon opportunities.\u00a0 This person would help shape the offers, messaging, and do the actual outreach. If you have experience with affiliates, event marketing, or B2B outreach, even better.\n\nI'm looking to create a place where cannabis businesses and folks in the industry can show their business off. I'm not looking for a news blog. I want this to be solely about individual businesses, who they are, what they do and what they have to offer. Need a plumber that can fix the water systems in your greenhouse at 4AM? Looking for a farm that gives tours? Want the fire weed of the week? Looking for a used part for that extractor? Find it on SMJ.\n\nI am offering a small equity stake in return. This is negotiable but real for the right two people that fit this description. This is an early-stage play that I\u2019ve bootstrapped this far and I already have thousands of members in place. I am ready to go full-in on building SMJ into something great, but I don\u2019t have any more cash to put into the project. I only have equity to offer.\u00a0\n\nWhat you earn is what we can produce together.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a way into the cannabis world, and a job you can do from anywhere in the world, this might be it.\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s build something smarter, fairer, and more useful to the cannabis community than Weedmaps ever dreamed of. BTW as of this writing, Weedmaps has a $112 million dollar valuation. They sell air.\u00a0\n\nMessage me or leave a comment if you're interested. I\u2019m looking for serious people only. Let's not waste each other's time. You know if you have what it takes.

Think LinkedIn meets Shopify, but for cannabis and ancillary businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, it\u2019s boring and doesn\u2019t really have a good look or feel to it.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ll admit it, the bones are there, the (9k non-paying) members are there, but the vision hasn\u2019t been fully realized yet. I\u2019ve been busy running multiple cannabis businesses i.e. retail, distribution, cultivation, you name it, and while SMJ has been quietly growing, it\u2019s now time for a real pivot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why now? Weedmaps has an absolute stranglehold on the U.S. cannabis industry, and it\u2019s toxic (imho). They charge ridiculous fees, bait and switch people on pricing, and treat small businesses like they\u2019re disposable. I know personally because they treated my businesses really badly. Their focus on just \u201cretail\u201d cannabis businesses is narrow.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry deserves better and there is a place for a new, better player.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created SMJ to be that better business.\u00a0 I have been trying to create a space that\u2019s fair, transparent, and designed to help everyone in the cannabis industry thrive, especially the businesses that get left out of the conversation because they are not retailers. I want SMJ to become a platform where each business and business owner can have their own page, post deals/coupons, upload media and articles, get analytics, and even run their own shop. Basically, it would be a white-labeled Shopify, Substack, Yelp, Craigslist, and Squarespace combo for cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All for a reasonable monthly subscription of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But obviously due to the completely non-paying membership I\u2019ve unfortunately created, this isn\u2019t working for me anymore.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m looking for a tech God or Goddess to help me out. Someone who can help me redesign and optimize the user experience, add core features like upgraded member dashboards, geolocation, automation, and payment integration, and turn this site into a platform people love to use. Ideally, you&amp;#39;re comfortable with marketplaces, scalable infrastructure, and creating a beautiful, functional front-end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also need a sales rockstar. Someone who understands the cannabis and hemp space, or can learn quickly, and knows how to sell an SaaS-style platform and also sell advertising and coupon opportunities.\u00a0 This person would help shape the offers, messaging, and do the actual outreach. If you have experience with affiliates, event marketing, or B2B outreach, even better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m looking to create a place where cannabis businesses and folks in the industry can show their business off. I&amp;#39;m not looking for a news blog. I want this to be solely about individual businesses, who they are, what they do and what they have to offer. Need a plumber that can fix the water systems in your greenhouse at 4AM? Looking for a farm that gives tours? Want the fire weed of the week? Looking for a used part for that extractor? Find it on SMJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am offering a small equity stake in return. This is negotiable but real for the right two people that fit this description. This is an early-stage play that I\u2019ve bootstrapped this far and I already have thousands of members in place. I am ready to go full-in on building SMJ into something great, but I don\u2019t have any more cash to put into the project. I only have equity to offer.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you earn is what we can produce together.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve been looking for a way into the cannabis world, and a job you can do from anywhere in the world, this might be it.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s build something smarter, fairer, and more useful to the cannabis community than Weedmaps ever dreamed of. BTW as of this writing, Weedmaps has a $112 million dollar valuation. They sell air.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Message me or leave a comment if you&amp;#39;re interested. I\u2019m looking for serious people only. Let&amp;#39;s not waste each other&amp;#39;s time. You know if you have what it takes.

We had a big roadmap of \u201cmust-have\u201d features. Guess what? Many weren\u2019t even requested. Instead, users asked for other things we hadn\u2019t even considered. Keeping the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) lean saved us a ton of time.\n\n\u2705 Real feedback &gt; gut feeling. We\u2019ve built multiple new features directly from user feedback\u2014and usage spiked every time we launched one. We stopped guessing and started listening.\n\n\u2705 AppSumo was perfect for validation. It gave us fast exposure, real paying users, and brutally honest feedback.

We had a big roadmap of \u201cmust-have\u201d features. Guess what? Many weren\u2019t even requested. Instead, users asked for other things we hadn\u2019t even considered. Keeping the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) lean saved us a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2705 Real feedback &amp;gt; gut feeling. We\u2019ve built multiple new features directly from user feedback\u2014and usage spiked every time we launched one. We stopped guessing and started listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2705 AppSumo was perfect for validation. It gave us fast exposure, real paying users, and brutally honest feedback.
