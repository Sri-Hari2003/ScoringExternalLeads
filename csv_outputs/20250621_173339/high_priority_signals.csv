This is how I sold my SAAS for 7 figures.

Step 1 : I went on linkedIn and searched for people buying SAAS (high intent lead, LOL) 

Step 2 : I found a guy called Jeremy. His bio was ""buying a SAAS biz this year""

Step 3 : I sent him a WhatsApp message (his number was public)

Step 4 : After 2 months of due diligence, my SAAS was sold !

Some infos :

1. My saas was making around 55k/month when I sold it (60% profit)
2. It was a shopify app (WhatsApp for Shopify stores, called COCO A",Cold_Presentation502,2025-06-19T02:13:39,142,0.7,8,,,,Reddit post from r/SaaS with 30 upvotes and 56 comments,7.2,0,"{""approved_at_utc"": null, ""subreddit"": ""SaaS"", ""selftext"": ""Hey guys.  \nThis is how I sold my SAAS for 7 figures.\n\nStep 1 : I went on linkedIn and searched for people buying SAAS (high intent lead, LOL) \n\nStep 2 : I found a guy called Jeremy.
